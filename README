RetroVol is a volume setting program.  It adds an icon to the tray that can be
scrolled on to change the volume.  It can be middle-clicked to mute/unmute. It
can be right-clicked to display the main window, which lists all the volume
controls it can detect on your system.

Configuration changes can be made in the ~/.retrovolrc file.  For example, you
can change the colors to green and blue, make the segments fatter, disable the
tray icon, and have the main window only display specific sliders.

At the moment, you must edit that file manually to make those changes.  I will
eventually make a gui tool for doing it though.

To see the names of the sliders that you can use in the 'sliders:' section,
run this command in a terminal:

amixer controls

That will spit out something that looks like this:

numid=37,iface=MIXER,name='Master Playback Switch'
numid=36,iface=MIXER,name='Master Playback Volume'
numid=19,iface=MIXER,name='Headphone Playback Switch'
numid=38,iface=MIXER,name='PCM Playback Volume'
numid=16,iface=MIXER,name='Front Mic Playback Switch'
numid=15,iface=MIXER,name='Front Mic Playback Volume'

You can ignore any "Switch" entries that have a corresponding "Volume" entry.
They will automatically be combined into one item.
