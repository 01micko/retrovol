RetroVol is a volume setting program.  It adds an icon to the tray that can be
scrolled on to change the volume.  It can be middle-clicked to mute/unmute. It
can be right-clicked to display the main window, which lists all the volume
controls it can detect on your system.

Configuration changes can be made in the ~/.retrovolrc file, or through the
preferences window at File->Configure.  For example, you can change the colors
to green and blue, make the segments fatter, disable the tray icon, and have
the main window only display specific sliders.

As of version 0.2, Retrovol will only allow one instance to run at a time.  If
you attempt to launch a second instance it will instead pop up the main window
if it isn't already visible.

Also, Retrovol accepts a -bg <hexcolor> commandline option to specify the tray
icon's background color.  Normally it will just use the normal GTK background
color, but if that doesn't match your tray, you can use this to adjust it.
This can also be specified in the config file (or through the preferences gui)
but those are not convenient to automatically update to match the colorscheme
when you change WM themes or whatever.  Thus the -bg option is provided so
that the script which launches Retrovol could look at the color of the theme
and supply that on the commandline, without needing to modify the config file.
