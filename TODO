:main window:
	?add editable numeric display - Will probably skip this to preserve screen space - make up for it with a tooltip?
	make sliders select when clicked on (so arrow keys work on them)
	improve layout of horizontal-mode - mute buttons are funky
	gradient colors in the slider
	"overload" colors in the slider
	commandline options to override the config file
	commandline option to specify config file, else use ~/.retrovolrc
	four radio boxes to switch view: Playback, Capture, All, Custom
	?custom sliders that operate multiple sliders at once
	status bar - shows full name of the device below cursor, along with numeric info - make optional in config file

:tray icon:
	use non-deprecated functions to position slider (inside a popup menu?)
	?replace eggtrayicon with the new statusicon of gtk that can be scrolled on? - probably do this as a compile option
