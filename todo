:main window:
	?add editable numeric display - Will probably skip this to preserve screen space - make up for it with a tooltip?
	improve layout of horizontal-mode - mute buttons are funky
	gradient colors in the slider
	"overload" colors in the slider
	commandline options to override the config file
	commandline option to specify config file, else use ~/.retrovolrc
	four radio boxes to switch view: Playback, Capture, All, Custom
	status bar - shows full name of the device below cursor, along with numeric info - make optional in config file
	:menu bar:
		exit program completely
		preferences
		gui to change order of sliders and enable/disable

:tray icon:
	use non-deprecated functions to position slider (inside a popup menu?)
	use transparent background so taskbar shows through.
	?should scrolling to increase sound level automatically unmute?  Would have to affect normal sliders too, so I think not.
	make tray_icon optional
